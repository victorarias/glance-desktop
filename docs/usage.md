# Using Glance

[Install](../README.md#install) · [Omarchy setup](linux.md) · [Tool options](../TOOL_OPTIONS.md)

Shortcuts below use macOS notation. On Omarchy, use **Ctrl** in place of **⌘**;
[Hyprland bindings](linux.md#capture-from-hyprland) provide global capture.

Glance’s interface follows the system’s light or dark appearance and updates when
it changes while the app is running. Image content, annotation colors, backdrops,
and exported media keep their colors.

## Capture or open an image

- **⌘⌥2** captures an area; Escape cancels the selector.
- **⌘⌥3** captures the main display. Glance hides itself before capture.
- **⌘O** opens PNG/JPEG. You can also drop a file onto the canvas.
- **⌘V** loads a clipboard image when you are outside text editing.

The starter image is a practice canvas. Save or copy your work before capturing,
opening, pasting a replacement, or quitting; editable sessions last for the current launch.
On macOS, closing the window keeps global shortcuts active. Click the Dock icon
to reopen it; **⌘Q** quits.

For capture permission help, see the [macOS FAQ](../README.md#macos-faq).

### Use the macOS screenshot shortcut

Click the **Native screenshots** clipboard button beside the capture buttons in
the toolbar to keep using **⌃⌘⇧4** (Control + Command + Shift + 4).
Allow Glance in **System Settings →
Privacy & Security → Input Monitoring**, then restart Glance or turn the setting
off and on. The button highlights when enabled; hover to see its state and shortcut.
The setting remembers your choice; Glance must be running.

Use the native selector as usual. Glance observes the shortcut without taking it
over, then opens the new clipboard image when you finish the selection. Space
switches to window capture. Escape cancels. File-saving shortcuts such as ⌘⇧4
and full-screen capture with ⌃⌘⇧3 are outside this setting.

If the current document has been edited, a text edit or gesture is unfinished,
or an operation is busy, the latest screenshot waits. **Open (replace current)**
replaces the image and its undo history; **Dismiss** keeps your work. A newer
capture replaces the pending screenshot. Save or copy work you want to keep
before opening the replacement.

Glance infers a capture from the shortcut, a completed selection, and a new
clipboard image. macOS does not identify the image's source through this API.
An unrelated key or clipboard ownership change cancels the pending detection;
clipboard handoff is limited to ten seconds after the selection finishes. The
selection itself has no time limit. Glance's own image copies are ignored.

## Annotate and select

| Tool | Key | How to use it |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Pen | P | Drag to draw |
| Arrow | A | Drag between endpoints; use the middle handle to bend it |
| Rectangle | R | Drag a box |
| Text | T | Click and type; Enter or clicking outside finishes, Escape cancels |
| Highlight | H | Drag over an area |
| Pixelate | B | Drag a region; block size is adjustable |
| Numbered callout | N | Click to place the next number |
| Spotlight | S | Drag a focus rectangle; the surrounding image dims |
| Magnifier | M | Drag from the source detail to the enlarged lens position |
| Crop | X | Drag to crop; undo restores the image |

Text labels are single-line; pasted line breaks become spaces. Text selection,
copy/paste, undo/redo, and native input methods work while editing.
Spotlights have corner handles; magnifiers have separate source and lens handles.
The magnifier enlarges the annotated foreground and keeps details bright within a spotlight.

New marks remain selected. Drag to move them, or click empty canvas to draw another.
Press **V** to select existing annotations. Click selects the topmost matching mark;
drag empty canvas to select marks whose bounds intersect the box.
**Shift-click** toggles one mark; **Shift-drag** adds to the selection.
**⌘A** selects all annotations, or text when editing a label or field.
Click empty canvas or press Escape to clear selection.

Drag any selected mark to move the group. **Delete**, **⌘D** (duplicate), and
**arrow keys** (nudge 1 pixel; Shift for 10) operate on the whole selection.
Color, width, and appearance edits apply to the group. Each group edit or drag
is one undo step; held nudge repeats are grouped. **⌘Z / ⌘⇧Z** undo/redo.

Hold **Shift** while drawing to snap arrows to 45° or make rectangles, highlights,
pixelation regions, and crops square. Shift-moving locks to the dominant axis.
Crop endpoints snap near image edges.

### Change tool options

The sidebar follows the selection or active tool, remembering each tool's defaults
for the session. Hover over **?** beside a tool name for help.

Click a numeric value to type an exact size or percentage. Enter or leaving the
field applies it; Escape cancels. Use a preset or custom color picker, enter
**#RGB / #RRGGBB**, or choose **Pick from screen**. Changing RGB preserves opacity.
Selected-annotation edits support undo. See the [tool reference](../TOOL_OPTIONS.md)
for line styles, pen cleanup, crop ratios, and other options.

## Resize, rotate, and navigate

Open **Image tools** to resize (50–400%) or rotate 90° clockwise. Smart upscale
resamples and sharpens the image. Resize redraws annotations at the new resolution;
crop and resize keep them editable. Rotation flattens them. Both support undo.
Resize is bounded to 16,000 pixels per side and 64 megapixels.
Backdrop padding stays in physical pixels.

Use **⌘1** to fit, **⌘0** for 100%, or **⌘+ / ⌘−** to zoom. Pinch zooms around
the pointer; two-finger scrolling pans. **⌘ + scroll** zooms; **Shift + wheel**
pans horizontally. Hold **Space** and drag, or right-drag, to pan.
Hold **Z** and click to zoom in at a spot; Shift-click zooms out.
Trackpad smart zoom toggles 100%/fit. Zoom ranges from 1–800%.

## Frame the image

Open **Backdrop** and choose **Solid**, **Gradient**, or **Motion**.

- **Format** offers Auto, aspect ratios, and YouTube/Shorts/Pinterest presets.
  Fixed formats center the full screenshot within the expanded background.
- **Outside padding** sets the minimum backdrop margin.
- **Inside padding** extends the screenshot's edge pixels before rounding and shadow.
- **Image corners** and **Shadow** style the screenshot.

Choose a palette or click a swatch for custom colors. Solid uses one color;
Gradient and Motion use two. **Pick from screen** opens the macOS eyedropper;
Omarchy requires `hyprpicker`. Colors are opaque sRGB. Custom colors survive effect
changes; choosing a palette resets them. Slider/color gestures are one undo step.

**Done** closes the panel. **Enable backdrop** toggles framing while retaining its settings.

## Animate

For a moving background, choose **Backdrop → Motion** and an effect: Flow,
Nebula, Aurora, Contours, Painterly, Prism, Liquid, or Lava. **Randomize** creates
an undoable variation while retaining colors, framing, duration, and preview time.
Set a 2–15 second cycle (5 seconds by default).

For a foreground entrance, open **Animation** and choose **Diagonal reveal**,
**Spring pop**, or **3D settle**. Set duration, delay, and clip length.
The screenshot, annotations, corners, and shadow animate together, with any
backdrop style. Choose **Hold** to leave the image visible or **Exit** to return
to the empty backdrop before repeating.

**Replay** restarts; **Play/Pause** and **Preview time** let you inspect frames.
“Preparing preview…” appears during startup or seeking; playback waits for the
requested frame. Close the panel or click the canvas to return to editing.
Timing changes are undoable; replay and seeking leave history unchanged.

## Copy, save, or export

**⌘C** copies the composed image; **⌘S** saves PNG. Both retain full resolution.
With Animation open, PNG/copy capture the inspected frame; during normal editing
they capture the fully revealed image.

Use **Export → GIF… / MP4…** for an animated backdrop or image entrance.
Exports begin at time zero and preserve aspect ratio:

| Format | Output |
| --- | --- |
| PNG | Full resolution, including transparency |
| GIF | Infinite repeat, 20 fps, maximum edge 960 pixels |
| MP4 | H.264, 30 fps, maximum edge 1920 pixels |

GIF/MP4 use an ivory matte for transparent areas. Configure the video player to
loop an MP4. The export progress bar stays at the bottom of the window;
**Cancel export**, **Export → Cancel export**, or Escape stops it.

Save dialogs suggest timestamped names in Pictures (PNG/GIF) or Movies (MP4).
Use the matching `.png`, `.gif`, or `.mp4` extension. Glance preserves the
confirmed filename. If you omit an extension and the appended filename already
exists, choose the full filename in the dialog to confirm replacement.

### Share a link

**Copy (remote) · ⌘⇧C** uploads the composed PNG to [glance.sh](https://glance.sh)
and copies `Screenshot: <url>`. Wait for **Link copied!**, then paste it into a chat.
Failed uploads preserve the clipboard.

Links expire after about 30 minutes. Anyone with the link can retrieve the image.
Uploads are encrypted and require internet; the service allows up to 15 MB per
image and 30 uploads/hour per IP. Crop out sensitive content before sharing;
pixelation is a visual effect rather than reliable removal of information.
See the [security policy](../SECURITY.md) for data handling.

## macOS accessibility

Toolbar and inspector controls, numeric values, color hex fields, sliders, and
Format/Export menus are exposed to accessibility. Exact-value edits use the same
validation and undo behavior as mouse input. The canvas reports source dimensions
and annotation count; drawing and on-canvas text use ordinary input.
